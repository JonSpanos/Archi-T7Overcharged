# Archi-T7 Overcharged

This is a custom fork of T7Overcharged to include [apclientpp](https://github.com/black-sliver/apclientpp) inside Call of Duty Black Ops 3. This is to enable the Black Ops 3 Zombies AP Mod. In addition it also removes components of T7Overcharged that are not used in AP.

## License 
As with T7Overcharged, this is liscenced under GLP3 (linked above). 



### The Original Readme.MD for T7Overcharged is included below for reference. 

# T7Overcharged

**T7Overcharged** gives Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 modders the ability to take their mods to the next level by providing an API between Lua and C++ and providing already worked out components.

## Features
- Hot reloading of lua scripts
- UI Errors now give a stack trace and don't cause a freeze
- Extending the asset limits
- External console and printing to the console from lua
- HTTP requests from lua
- Discord Rich Presence
- Bullet depletion
- More to come!

## How to use
- Clone this repo or download the latest release.
- Copy the lua files to the mod/map you want to use this in.
- Copy the dll to the zone folder
- Add the following lines to your zone file:
```
rawfile,ui/util/T7Overcharged.lua
rawfile,ui/util/T7OverchargedUtil.lua
```
- Add the following lines in your main lua file:
```
require("ui.util.T7Overcharged")
```
- Under that add the following code but change variables to your map/mod's information

for a mod:
```
InitializeT7Overcharged({
	modname = "t7overcharged",
	filespath = [[.\mods\t7overcharged\]],
	workshopid = "45131545",
	discordAppId = nil,--"{{DISCORD_APP_ID}}" -- Not required, create your application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/
	showExternalConsole = true
})
```
for a map:
```
InitializeT7Overcharged({
	mapname = "zm_t7overcharged",
	filespath = [[.\usermaps\zm_t7overcharged\]],
	workshopid = "45131545",
	discordAppId = nil,--"{{DISCORD_APP_ID}}" -- Not required, create your application at https://discord.com/developers/applications/
	showExternalConsole = true
})
```
The [dvar hash list](usage/dvar_hash_list.txt) as of now isn't shipped with the DLL, it has to be manually placed inside of the root folder of Black Ops 3.
